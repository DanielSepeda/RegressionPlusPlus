# RegressionCpp
Linear Regression Theory and Practice. 

Implementing fast, and efficient regression models and analysis in C++ with Eigen as core. 
We hope to offer powerful CPU/GPU acceleration using OpenMP and CUDA C back-ends.
We will use R calls to help with visualizations and cross validation. 
Most implementations will be based off of Introduction To Regression Analysis by Peck and Montegomery.
This is a personal project and is free to contribution.
